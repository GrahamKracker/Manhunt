flow:
host: sets lobby settings

when going to host game, create a lobby with default settings and instantly go to the waiting room/lobby screen
this is where the host can modify settings such as time limit, time to return limit, the map boundaries, and other game rules
other players  join the lobby while the host is setting up the rules and can see the changes in real time


once the host is satisfied with the settings, they can ready up and when all players are ready, the host can start the game
the game then begins with the agreed upon settings

the game logic will reference the lobby settings to enforce the rules during gameplay
for example, if the time limit is set to 10 minutes, the game will end after that duration
if the map boundaries are set, players will be restricted to those areas

the lobby settings will be saved for future games within that lobby session, but are reset when a new lobby is created

when a game ends, players are returned to the lobby where they can adjust settings for the next round or exit the lobby entirely

at any point players can leave the lobby, and if the host leaves, a new host is assigned from the remaining players
the lobby system ensures a smooth transition between game setup, gameplay, and post-game activities while allowing for customizable game settings

if a player disconnects during the game, they will rejoin, need to ensure that players are linked to device ids or some sort of static identifier to handle reconnections properly

the server and client will use the same basic types and structures to represent lobby settings to ensure consistency and reduce serialization/deserialization overhead

lobby settings structure:
- time limit (integer, minutes)
- return to safe zone time limit (integer, seconds)
- whether there is a safe zone (boolean)
- map boundary, either selected on a map by the host or a radius from the safe zone (if no safe zone, host current location will be used)
- time that seekers must wait before they can start seeking (integer, seconds)
